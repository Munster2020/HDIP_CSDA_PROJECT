## Project 2020 – Fisher’s Iris Data Set


### Problem Statement
This project deals with Fisher's Iris data set. For the project I had to research the data set and write documentation and code in Python to investigate it. The approach given was to break the project into several smaller tasks and then plug them together once completed.

### Summary
The Iris flower data set was compiled by Ronald Fisher in the 1930's. Fisher was born in London in 1890 and went on to become one of the most highly regarded statisticians of the 20th Century. He pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the dsign of scientific experiments. In tandem with his work in statistics he was also one of the principal founders of population eugenics. His work in biology led to the the geneticist and author Richard Dawkins calling him the greatest biologist since Charles Darwin.

Fisher introduced the Iris Flower data set in a paper published in "The Annals of Human Genetics" in 1936 called "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The dataset cotains three classes of fifty instances each. Each class refers to a type of iris plant. The first two species Iris setosa and Iris versicolour, were found growing together in the same colony.The third species called Iris virginica was taken from a different colony.

The data set contains the following attibutes.

(1) sepal length in cms

(2) sepal width in cms

(3) petal length in cms

(4) petal width in cms

(5) class:

   * Iris setosa
    
   * Iris versicolour
    
   * Iris virginica
